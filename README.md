# Jamf IP Scraper

~~After being burned one too many times by Jamf making opaque changes to their outbound cloud traffic, I got fed up and wrote a script that scrapes their [article outlining their outbound IPs/Domains](https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/technical-articles/page/Permitting_InboundOutbound_Traffic_with_Jamf_Cloud.html) and 
converts it into an easily digested JSON file ([jamf_outbound_traffic.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UWEC-SMC/jamf_ip_scraper/main/jamf_outbound_traffic.json)). This has the advantage of not only allowing admins the ability to programmatically process these values, but also provides an easily understood change log.~~

Hazzah! Jamf has listened and finally released an auto-generated site publishing their inbound/outbound IP ranges and hostnames, see the (11.22.0 release notes)[https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-release-notes-current/page/New_Features_and_Enhancements.html]. This auto-generated page hosts machine-readible copies in (JSON)[https://engineering.jamf.com/tc-docs-public-ip-lists/public-ips.json]) and (YAML)[https://engineering.jamf.com/tc-docs-public-ip-lists/public-ips.yaml] as well as a (change log)[https://engineering.jamf.com/tc-docs-public-ip-lists/changelog.json]. The auto-generated page can be found at https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-ip-address-list/page/Permitting_InboundOutbound_Traffic_with_Jamf.html.

Since Jamf now maintains their own publically hosted JSON and change log, this service has been rendered defunct so I'm shutting it down (least my local runner). This repo will be archived so other may reference it in the future, but be aware that jamf_outbound_traffic.json will no longer be updated as of 10/28/2025.
